> Ou part l'argent du contribuable ? Where does the taxpayer's money go?

This repository is a exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a french public data set (<https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/>)

The dataset describes the grant applications made by associations/NGO to several french public administrations, and their outputs (granted/not granted, amount given, date, sector, etc.).

Hence the name "Ou part l'argent du contribuable ?" (_"Where does the taxpayer's money go?"_)

The dataset is available at `./work/data/subventions-accordees-et-refusees.csv`

The Jupyter notebook containing the EDA is available at `./work/presentation.ipynb`
